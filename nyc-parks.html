                         This is a visual story about how much of NYC's park space is actually what you and I might think of as "park space"–accessible, green, and open for recreational use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        First, I took a look at the city wide data--a 2,000+ row long CSV file that NYC Open data has on all of the park proerties in New York. Luckily, this dataset includes pretty comprehensive documentation that explains each type of park property. I used pandas to analyze how much park space is actually available to us for recreational use.

                   <p class="para">
                        To bring the data a bit closer to home, I took a look at park properties (as labeled by Google Maps) around my neighborhood. What I found was that out of the 20+ park properties I visited, only 2 had green space and were open to the public at all times!
